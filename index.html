        <h2 style="text-align: center; font-family: Calibri; font-size: 24px;">About Us</h2>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">Oz Foundation has been helping scholars since 2004. We are a family foundation that strongly believes a college education is the gateway to a successful future. We feel that financial hardship should not deter individuals from reaching this goal.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: 18px;">Oz Foundation is a family foundation that operates in Santa Clara and San Diego Counties. We feel strongly about the value of a college education, and help to provide for those who would otherwise not be able to afford it. In addition to financial support, we provide personal mentorship to assist our students in their studies and the adjustment to college life.</p>
